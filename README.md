### Project Overview 

Youâ€™ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **weâ€™re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your own project, your instructors will partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an application of your own design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** Itâ€™s a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what you'll be doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own frontend
* **Use a MERN tech stack**, React for the frontend, with an express-node-mongo backend
* **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models. However, this is ultimately up to your discretion.
* **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible. We will have a deploy jam during project week


### Completed Projects:

* A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * Include a screenshot of the site in repo's README
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** â€“ who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** â€“ sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
 
 ## Brainstorm Deliverable
 
Tonight you will begin working with your group to explore project ideas and group workflow. The end goal is having 3 project ideas to discuss in class tommorrow.
 
### How Do We Do That?

#### DISCUSS GROUP ROLES

Begin planning out the structure

* Your group will need a **git manager** -- this person will oversee the project repos, pull requests and help group members wil git related issues
    * the git manager will need to assist the whole group with difficult issues -- this person should be eager to develop a more in depth knowledge of git by facing challenging bugs
* Your group will need a **SCRUM manager** -- this person will oversee daily sprints and make sure everyone is on track and working together
* *successful teams emphasize the strengths of team members* talk about your strenghts and interests -- what does each team member bring to the table?

**For example, you could discuss:**
* who is best at/likes backend more
* who likes frontend?
* who has an eye for design
* who is familiar with speciifc tech frameworks?

### RESEARCH

Research the tools and techs you want to use for your p3

* Find techs and APIs that look interesting -- how can you use them in your project?
* Are there any node packages you could use>?
* what about frameworks for UI?
* explore the techs you would like to use and most importantly -- work with them!
    * get node packages up and running 
    * get api keys and explore the responses
* Explore Colloaboration tools that you would like to use
    * [Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) is great for sharing and collabing on markdowns
    * [Trello Boards](https://trello.com/) Can halp teams manage sprints and tasks
    * [Miro Canvases](https://miro.com/) Are great for collaboration spaces to house everything your team needs to communicate and work together

### ASSIGN TASKS

Alot more can get done when everyone knows what to do and is all working independantly towards the same goal. Know who needs to do what and ork together together help each other out!

### SOLO WORK

* Spend time researching for your specific tasks
* save resources you find for reference!
* look back on classwork and deliverables -- fill in knowledge gaps while preparing for the project

## Deliverable Submission

Turn three of your favorite ideas into **elevator pitches**, -- *a one to two minute presentation per idea that conveys the why and how of your product, as well as the APIs and technologies that you plan on using to realize your this idea.*

* Example format: *When TARGET USERS want/need THIS THING, I help provide them a solution by DOING THIS. I will be leveraging THESE TECHNOLOGIES* - [Kayla Abanda](https://kaylabanda.com/2020/03/09/the-easiest-way-to-create-a-killer-elevator-pitch/)
* Your git manager should submit a pull request on this repo with your **elevator pitches** written in this markdown or separate file.
* Be prepared to give your **elevator ptich** in class as a group to complete this deliverable.
